Hi, I'm sp.  In the last 30 years, I have picked up (and put down) various programming languages.  Now, I am trying to focus on C/C++ by using the SDL Library to create a NES-ish style top-down RPG.  Feel free to browse my code and tell me what I'm doing wrong.  Try to stick to one or two things at a time, though.  As my wife will happily tell you, listing everything I'm doing wrong would just take all day.

You can contact me on reddit at u/slackpipe.
